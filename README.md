# gee_classificaTION

A project focused on **Land Cover Classification using Google Earth Engine (GEE) with Random Forest Machine Learning**.

## Overview

**gee_classificaTION** is designed to perform supervised land cover classification by leveraging satellite data, machine learning, and the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. The project utilizes a Random Forest classifier to generate a land cover map for a selected region based on training points and input satellite imagery. Outputs include classified maps, model accuracy assessments, and supporting visualizations, suitable for research, monitoring, and spatial analysis.

## Features

- **Supervised Land Cover Classification** using Google Earth Engine (GEE)
- **Random Forest Model** for robust classification
- Training Data Preparation with custom sample points and polygons
- Interactive Results Visualization: classified maps in HTML and PNG formats
- Accuracy Evaluation: confusion matrix and metrics
- **Model Reusability:** Reload and apply the trained model for new regions
- Documentation and supporting files for replicability

## Live Outputs and Datasets

The following outputs are available and hosted via GitHub Pages for direct viewing and sharing:

- **Model Output for Main Region**  
  [land_cover_classification_map.html](https://dhruv-218.github.io/gee_classification/land_cover_classification_map.html):  
  *This is the output classified land cover map generated by the model.*

- **Region of Interest Visualization**  
  [polygon_region.html](https://dhruv-218.github.io/gee_classification/polygon_region.html):  
  *This page displays the specific polygon/region used for classification and experiment validation. Demonstrates output when the saved model is applied at new coordinates.*

- **Training Dataset Visualization**  
  [datapoints.html](https://dhruv-218.github.io/gee_classification/datapoints.html):  
  *Shows the sample points and training dataset that you preparedâ€”these are the foundations for the classification workflow.*

## Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Define a region of interest (ROI), e.g., by drawing polygons.
- Collect **training samples**: Use polygons/points labeled with land cover classes.
- Visualize samples via [`datapoints.html`](https://dhruv-218.github.io/gee_classification/datapoints.html).

### 2. Satellite Data Selection
- Access satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2) via Google Earth Engine.

### 3. Model Training and Classification
- Run `final_gee_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter.
- Train the Random Forest classifier, apply to selected image, and export outputs:
  - Classified map ([land_cover_classification_map.html](https://dhruv-218.github.io/gee_classification/land_cover_classification_map.html))
  - Accuracy/confusion matrix (`matrix_randomforest.png`)

### 4. Model Export/Re-use
- Trained model saved as `gee_random_forest_model_1000.json` for deployment.
- Apply saved model at new coordinates/regions ([polygon_region.html](https://dhruv-218.github.io/gee_classification/polygon_region.html)).

## Usage

### Requirements
